 # Progressive Web App shopping-cart

## Description
A website that disguise as mobile app. Hmmmmm.. üßêüí≠

This project is a part of conquering frontend journey. 
In order to make HTML, CSS and JavaScript second nature, this series of simple project will use the basics yet the very fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This time with an addition with database to store the data, which we'll be using Firebase from Google.

This is fun!!
Getting some ideas to create an app from the place where i spend my time doing part-time job as Barista. 
I have noticed that most of the time, some stuffs that we need in order to make the coffee are out of stock, so we have to get some things from the store.
It is our responsibility to report if things are low in stock or even out of stock.
Some misscommunications could happen all the time. Double purchase or even did not get any notes.

This app is very simple one and might be the solution! 
Just add the stuffs to the app, and it will appears as shopping list, where all the members can see,
add and delete the stuffs from the list.


Through this project we can learn the basic topic of HTML, CSS and JS by implementing it on the use case.
For instance, manipulating the DOM using innerHTML and later on creating HTML element using JS. As the data we get from the Firestore is an Object type,
we need to convert to Array. 
Furthermore looping is essential in almost every programming language, so is here with JavaScript.
We need to loop the data return from the DB, so it could get rendered by manipulating the DOM.
Then, there's Firestore where we use its RealTime database.
